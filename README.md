## Scope of the project: 
- Develop and optimize a Supervised Learning Regression model to predict with lowest RMSE than competitors the price of a sample of diamonts. 


## Top Down approach for model development:

- 1)Exploration of the data on data-exploration.ipynb

- 2)Selection of the Framework model between (Linear Regression, Lasso & Random Tree) based on RMSE minimization

- 3)Optimization of the model:
                  - Feeding it with different Samples
                  - Performing Grid Search
                  - Finetunning the model manually.

## End results on Train.csv:
- RMSE Test around 535
- RMSE Train around 205


## Conclusions:
Seams that the model could be improved reducing the overfit, but would need more time
